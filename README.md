gwt-leaflet
===========

A __lightweight__ mapping alternative to popular mapping APIs like Google Maps API and OpenLayers for GWT. 

The library uses [Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/), an open-source javascript library for 
mobile-friendly interactive maps by [CloudMade](http://cloudmade.com/), to implement collection of mapping 
[Widgets](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/Widget.html)
which GWT projects can use to implement mapping capabilites on the [client-side](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/FAQ_Client) 
of a GWT application. The [Leaflet API](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html) is a third-party javascript
and is integrated with GWT as Java classes using [JSNI](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsJSNI)
and [Type Overlays](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay). 

Only those parts of the Leaflet API in use by gwt-leaflet is implemented so far, but it is a long-term goal to 
fully integrate the Leaflet API as the project progress.
